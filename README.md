  By developing a machine learning prediction model, the project makes a significant 
attempt to alleviate the problem of cost loss. The state authority and end user modules are highly 
significant in this module. Because the output of the aforesaid prediction model is depending on 
the input data, data plays a critical role here. The information on agricultural production from 
previous years is contained in this data. 
                It also contains the following information: the crop's producing area, weather data, and 
so on. So, when your data is good, you will receive more accurate results, so filter and remove all 
the useless data and create a dataset file in csv format from which the relevant data will be 
considered for computation. The most difficult part of the project was gathering data for input 
because agriculture data is proprietary and difficult to obtain. This is a general project since it can 
still be improved, which will be discussed in the future enhancement chapter.
